# Task
Print Hello, World! to stdout.

# Solution
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

In Python, the print function is used to output different data types. In this problem, it asks to print 'Hello, World!'. Since this is a sentence, the phrase 'Hello, World!' can be interpreted as a string data type. <br>
<br>

To declare a string in Python either single quotes '' or double quotes "" can be used. Within the single or double quotes, any statement can be written. To print the string '' or "", place it with the parenthesis of the print() function and run the program.
