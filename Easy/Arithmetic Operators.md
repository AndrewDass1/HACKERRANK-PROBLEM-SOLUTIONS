# Task
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where: <br>
<br>
1.   The first line contains the sum of the two numbers. <br>
2.   The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second). <br>
3.   The third line contains the product of the two numbers. <br>

# Procedure

1. Declare variables a and b:

```
a = int(input("")
b = int(input("")
```

2. Now on different lines, print the addition, subraction and the product:
```
print(a + b )

print(a - b)

print(a * b)
```

# Solution
```
a = int(input("")
b = int(input("")

print(a + b )

print(a - b)

print(a * b)
```
