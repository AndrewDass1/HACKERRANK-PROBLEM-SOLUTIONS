# Task

The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN. <br>
<br>
Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a
// b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b. <br>

No rounding or formatting is necessary. <br>

# Procedure
Declare two variables a and b respectively to be integers:
```
a = int(input(""))
b = int(input(""))
```

Then proceed to print the integer and float division of a and b on two separate lines
```
print(a//b)
print(a/b)
```

# Solution
```
a = int(input(""))
b = int(input(""))
print(a//b)
print(a/b)
```
