## Explanation
In Python, to print statements or variables to the console, the keyword "print()" is needed. Within the parenthesis, string type data or name of already declared variables can be chosen to be printed out. Shown below, the first statement is 'Hello, World' is printed and then the variable "input_string" is printed in the second print statement. 
## Solution
```
# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
input_string = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# TODO: Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(input_string)
```
