# Solution
To print the last characters of any file, use the command "tail", and afterwards specify the letter -c and a number. -c means to print out characters in the Terminal and the number specifies how many of the last characters will be printed out. In this case, the "tail -c 20" means the last 20 characters are printed out.
```
tail -c 20
```
