# Solution
To print the last lines of any file, use the command "tail", afterwards specify the letter -n and a number. -n means to print out lines in the Terminal and the number specifies how many of the last lines will be printed out. In this case, the "tail -n 20" means the last 20 lines are printed out.
```
tail n -20
```
